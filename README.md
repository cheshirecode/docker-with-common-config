# (WIP) Multi-app Docker setup with common config

This provides building blocks using Docker based on what I've been trying to
achieve with current setup:

* Splitting one application into many.
* Some share certain configurations.
* Some are standalones.
* One can redirect to another, or a proxy layer (also Docker-ised).
