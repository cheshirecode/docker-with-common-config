# Barebone container to set up 1st FE environment

* Requires `docker` and `docker-compose`.
* Execute `run.sh` for Linux/Mac or `run.ps1` for Windows.
* You should know see the CLI prompt inside the container

```
/usr/node/app
```

* Do your thing, like `yarn add <package>` and see the updates reflected in host
  folder.
* Out of the box, the Dockerfile has this `CMD` instruction:

```
CMD tail -f /dev/null
```

to force the container to run forever. Eventually during development you would
replace it with `node ...`, `yarn start` or another startup script.
